# Hidden Markov Models for Human Activity Recognition

## Project Overview

This repository implements a complete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system for human activity recognition using smartphone sensor data. The project demonstrates how to model human activities as hidden states and infer them from noisy accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Generate realistic sensor data for 4 human activities
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract time and frequency domain features from sensor signals
- **HMM Modeling**: Implement Hidden Markov Models to classify activities
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy and generalization

## 📊 Activities Modeled

| Activity | Description | Key Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Standing** | Person standing still with phone at waist level | Stable gravity readings, minimal variation |
| **Walking** | Person walking at consistent pace | Periodic patterns at ~1.8 Hz |
| **Jumping** | Person performing continuous jumps | High amplitude spikes at ~1 Hz |
| **Still** | Phone placed on flat surface | Minimal noise, near-perfect gravity |

##  Quick Start

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn
```

### Step 1: Generate Realistic Sensor Data
```bash
cd hmm_activity_data
python generate_dummy_data.py
```
- Creates 18,560 sensor readings across 4 activities
- 50 Hz sampling rate with realistic noise patterns
- Generates individual CSV files per activity

### Step 2: Extract Features
```bash
python feature_extraction.py
```
- Extracts 140 features per 2-second window
- Time-domain: statistics, correlations, signal properties
- Frequency-domain: FFT analysis, spectral features
- Creates 365 feature vectors ready for modeling

### Step 3: Analyze Features (Optional)
```bash
python feature_analysis_demo.py
```
- Feature importance analysis using Random Forest
- PCA dimensionality reduction
- Activity transition probability calculation
- Generates HMM-ready feature set (20 best features)
