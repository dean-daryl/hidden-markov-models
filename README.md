# Hidden Markov Models for Human Activity Recognition

## Project Overview

This repository implements a complete Hidden Markov Model (HMM) system for human activity recognition using smartphone sensor data. The project demonstrates how to model human activities as hidden states and infer them from noisy accelerometer and gyroscope measurements.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Generate realistic sensor data for 4 human activities
- **Feature Extraction**: Extract time and frequency domain features from sensor signals
- **HMM Modeling**: Implement Hidden Markov Models to classify activities
- **Performance Evaluation**: Assess model accuracy and generalization

## 📊 Activities Modeled

| Activity | Description | Key Characteristics |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Standing** | Person standing still with phone at waist level | Stable gravity readings, minimal variation |
| **Walking** | Person walking at consistent pace | Periodic patterns at ~1.8 Hz |
| **Jumping** | Person performing continuous jumps | High amplitude spikes at ~1 Hz |
| **Still** | Phone placed on flat surface | Minimal noise, near-perfect gravity |
